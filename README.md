# LWJGLBotanico
A game written in Java 8 using LWJGL 3.

This was a project I worked on a few months a while ago, I figured I would make this public because why not.

I'm still particularly proud of using fractals to generate terrain, the results were surprisingly good. Peak in the spaghetti if you dare!
